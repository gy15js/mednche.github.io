Mapping places mentionned in a poem - an application of Natural Language Processing
<!--more-->

These projects have been developped as part of the module *Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Advanced Skills* from the University of Leeds (2017-2018).

The aim of this project was to familiarise myself with Natural Language Processing through the application of Part of Speech tagging. 
The project also involves automatic querrying of the Google API as well as the use of Bokeh interractive maps to visualise the results. 

More information can be found in the [Github repository of the project](https://github.com/mednche/AdvancedProgrammingSkills/tree/master/NLP).
